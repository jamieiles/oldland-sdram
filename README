SDR SDRAM controller
====================

This is a simple 16 bit single data rate SDRAM controller.  Currently all
accesses are single accesses and auto precharged so it's not really optimized.
Accesses are performed when h_bytesel != 0, and the h_compl signal is strobed
when the access has completed.
